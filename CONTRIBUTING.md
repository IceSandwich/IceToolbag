# Develop effect script

All effects are defined in `src/operators/richstrip/effects`.

1. Copy `src/operators/richstrip/effects/develop/TEMPLATE.py` to `src/operators/richstrip/effects` and rename it.

2. The comments in `TEMPLATE.py` will guide you to write codes.

4. Restart blender and you can see the result.

I prefer to use [Blender Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development) addon in vscode so i can reload addon without restarting blender.

`gaussianblur.py` is a good example to start with.

Any api will change until it reaches stable version but won't change frequently in the near future.
