# IceToolbag
A blender addon for VSE.

Like its name, this toolbag should contain lots of things but not now.

This addon is made for private use. I'm glad if it can help you.

## Notice :bell:

**This addon is still in develop. Some feature may not work properly. Current version: 0.0.1 alpha**

## Features :flags:

- Marker

  Marker mainly does the alignment task, such as `beat match`. Also the marker layer manager is provided.

| Feature         | Description                                                  | Demo                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Batch rename    | rename all marker(`%d` represent the index of marker).       | ![](doc/marker.gif) |
| Marker Layer    | now marker has layer too. you can switch to another layer or rename this marker layer. | ![](doc/switch.gif) |
| Align to marker | Align a strip to marker                                      |                     |
| Beat match      | input two marker layers with the corresponding markers of movie and audio, this operation will match them using `speed` strip. |                     |

- Effects (:key: animation support, :hammer_and_wrench:developing, :x: outdated )

  RichStrip is a template-base system which allows you to stack effects easily. All parameters are exposed so user can adjust them in one panel. This system is extensible. You can write your own effects.

| Features            | Description                                                  | Demo               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Convert 2 RichStrip | Before adding effects to a strip, you need to select a movie and an audio strip or just one movie strip to convert. | ![](doc/c2rs.gif)  |
| Original Effect:key: | This effect represents the original strip which cannot be created manually but has lots of control like transformation and rotation. | ![](doc/ori.gif)   |
| FastBlur Effectâ€‹ :key: | Blender has Gaussian blur but pretty slow and not perfect when we want a blur background. This effect does a trick to blur the background. | ![](doc/fblur.gif) |
| Ramp Effect :hammer_and_wrench: | Like ramp node in nuke but less control. **Still has some bugs about the formulation.** | ![](doc/ramp.gif)  |
| Copy Effect :x: | ~~Must select an effect you want to copy before adding this effect.~~(**OUTDATED**) | ![](doc/copy.gif) |
| Matte Effect :hammer_and_wrench: | Simple matte effect. **Still in progress.**                  | ![](doc/matte.gif) |
| Pixelize Effect :key: | Mosaic effect.                                               | ![](doc/other.gif) |
| Mirror Effect :key: :hammer_and_wrench: | Reflection effect. **Still in progress. Doesn't work properly.** | |
|Bright/Contrast Effect :key:|Adjust the bright and contrast.||
| Glow Effect :key: | Blender internal effect. |                    |
|Gaussian Blur Effect :key:|Blender internal effect.||

## TODO/Planning :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- support move up and down the effect.
- add more effects.
- effects should has clip property and can interactive in viewport.
- develop Slider Strip, Subtitle Strip, etc.
- draw basic shape in viewport.
- add common sticker, maybe a sticker library.

## Known Issues :bug:

- when dragging the value, it seems blender costs lots of memory due to cache manager of blender.


## Changelog :bookmark_tabs:
0.0.1 alpha
1. support keyframes animation for most properties.
2. get rid of copy effect since we can duplicate richstrip.
3. update some api of base effect class, so everyone can write his own effect.

## Last things...  :blush:
